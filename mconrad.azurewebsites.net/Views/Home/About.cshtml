        Hi, my name is Michael Conrad, I'm programmer since 1996. <br />
        <hr />
        <br />I'm working the past years at <a href="http://urbanscience.com/">Urban Science</a> as a Principal Developer
        with a nice Team and always lots of work ahead.
        <br />
        This web site though should be completely independent from my work at Urban Science and
        I'd like to share the fun stuff I'm sometimes working on in my spare time.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you want get in touch with me via Twitter, Github or my Blog!
